# User Story: Quality Analysis

**Feature ID**: P3-F03-quality-analysis
**Phase**: P3 (cursor-sim Research Framework)
**Created**: January 3, 2026
**Status**: COMPLETE

## Overview

As a **SDLC researcher**, I want **GitHub simulation with quality analysis endpoints** so that I can **study code survival, revert patterns, and hotfix correlations** with AI usage intensity.

## User Stories

### US-SIM-C00: PR Generation Pipeline

**As a** researcher studying PR patterns
**I want** realistic PRs generated from commit sessions
**So that** I can analyze PR lifecycle metrics

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- PRs emerge from commit groupings with session-based parameters
- Session parameters vary by developer seniority
- Inactivity gaps define PR boundaries

### US-SIM-C01: GitHub Routes

**As a** developer using GitHub-compatible APIs
**I want** all 12 GitHub routes to return real data
**So that** I can use standard GitHub tooling

### US-SIM-C02: Code Survival Calculator

**As a** researcher studying code quality
**I want** file-level survival tracking
**So that** I can measure code longevity by AI usage

### US-SIM-C03: Revert Chain Analysis

**As a** researcher studying code stability
**I want** revert detection with risk scoring
**So that** I can correlate AI usage with revert rates

### US-SIM-C04: Hotfix Tracking

**As a** researcher studying post-merge quality
**I want** hotfix detection for merged PRs
**So that** I can measure quick-follow-up fix patterns

### US-SIM-C05: Research Dataset Enhancement

**As a** researcher needing complete data
**I want** all 38 columns in the research dataset
**So that** I can run comprehensive statistical analyses
