Read .claude/DEVELOPMENT.md and docs/TASKS.md to determine what task I should work on next.

Consider:
- Current project phase from DEVELOPMENT.md
- Dependencies between tasks in TASKS.md
- What's already completed
- P0 status

Show me:
1. The next task ID and name
2. Brief description
3. Which service it belongs to
4. Recommended model (from .claude/skills/model-selection-guide.md)
5. Key files to read (SPEC.md sections)
