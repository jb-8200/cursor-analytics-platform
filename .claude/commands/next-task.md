Read .claude/DEVELOPMENT.md and docs/TASKS.md to determine what task I should work on next.

Consider:
- Current project phase from DEVELOPMENT.md
- Active work item from `.claude/plans/active` symlink
- Current task status in `.work-items/{feature}/task.md`
- Dependencies between tasks
- What's already completed

Show me:
1. The next task/step ID and name
2. Brief description
3. Which service it belongs to
4. Recommended model (the `model-selection-guide` skill will help)
5. Key files to read (SPEC.md sections)
6. Estimated hours
