Help me choose the right Claude model for a task.

When I provide a task ID or description:

1. Read .claude/skills/model-selection-guide.md
2. Check the task-to-model mapping
3. Consider:
   - Is it well-specified in SPEC.md? → Haiku
   - Complex logic or architecture? → Sonnet
   - Novel or cross-service? → Opus

Show:
- Recommended model with emoji (⚡ Haiku, ⚡⚡ Sonnet, ⚡ Opus)
- Reason for recommendation
- Estimated cost
- Alternative models and trade-offs
