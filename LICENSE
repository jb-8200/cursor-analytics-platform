   claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by
   their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with

   patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or
   counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution

   for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution.
   You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works
   thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or
   Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

   (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a
       copy of this License; and

   (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating
       that You changed the files; and

   (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You
       distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices
       from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not
       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and

   (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution,
       then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable
       copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file,
       excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the
       Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a
       NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the
       Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative
       Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the
       NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the
       License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works
       that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from
       the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be
       construed as modifying the License.

   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may
   provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use,
   reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such
   Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and
   distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in
   this License.

5. Submission of Contributions.
   Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally
   submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under
   the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or
   conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or
   modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks.
   This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks,
   service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for
   reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and
   reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty.
   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides
   the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS"
   BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of
   TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
   PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of
   using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your
   exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability.
   In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including
   negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such
   as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any
   Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect,
   special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work
   (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage,
   computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or
   losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of
   such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.
   While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to
   offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or
   other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License.
   However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf
   and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and
   only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless
   for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor
   by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

10. Commercial Production Use License Fee and Waivers.

   10.1 Trigger.
       If You are a Commercial Organization and You engage in Production Use of
       the Work (or any Derivative Works), and more than five (5) Authorized
       Developers have access to or use the Work (or any Derivative Works),
       then You must obtain a paid commercial license from the Licensor prior
       to such use.

   10.2 Quote and Contact.
       To obtain a quote and commercial license terms, contact:
       jb@jishutech.io

   10.3 Limited Free Use.
       Section 10.1 does not apply to:
       (a) non-commercial organizations; or
       (b) Production Use where the total number of Authorized Developers is
           five (5) or fewer; or
       (c) non-production evaluation, proof-of-concept, or testing use.

   10.4 Effect of Non-Compliance.
       Any use that violates Section 10.1 is unlicensed. Upon such violation,
       all rights granted to You under this License terminate immediately.

   10.5 Consultancy Retainer Waiver (Commercial Organizations).

       (a) Eligibility.
           The requirement in Section 10.1 is waived for a Commercial
           Organization during any period in which that organization is actively
           engaged with the Licensor for professional services and consultancy,
           and the organization pays fees to the Licensor in an amount greater
           than USD 9,700 per month, provided that:
           (i) the consultancy agreement is in full force and effect; and
           (ii) all amounts due are received by the Licensor when due.

       (b) Scope and Duration.
           This waiver applies only while the conditions in Section 10.5(a)
           remain continuously satisfied. The waiver does not grant any
           perpetual, vested, or irrevocable rights beyond the duration of the
           qualifying consultancy engagement.

       (c) End of Engagement.
           Upon expiration, termination, suspension, non-renewal, or any other
           event causing the consultancy engagement to cease being in effect, or
           upon any failure to pay amounts due (including late payment) such
           that the Licensor has not received payment when due, the waiver in
           Section 10.5(a) ends immediately.

       (d) Consequences of End of Engagement.
           Upon the waiver ending under Section 10.5(c), all rights to use the
           Work (and any Derivative Works) are void unless the organization has
           obtained a paid commercial license from the Licensor. The
           organization must, within thirty (30) days of the waiver ending,
           either:
           (i) purchase and maintain a paid commercial license; or
           (ii) permanently cease all use, remove and destroy all copies of the
                Work and Derivative Works under its control, and delete any
                data, outputs, artifacts, or materials that were produced or
                generated by the Work (including by any Derivative Works),
                except to the extent retention is required by applicable law.

       (e) Audit and Verification.
           The Licensor may request reasonable written evidence of eligibility
           under Section 10.5(a), including proof of payment receipt and
           confirmation of the number of Authorized Developers. Failure to
           provide such evidence within a reasonable time is deemed
           ineligibility and the waiver ends.

       (f) No Implied License.
           This waiver is a conditional exception to Section 10.1 only and does
           not otherwise modify the License.
